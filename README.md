# Emacs.d

This repository contains my emacs configuration largely inspired (and some parts copied) from [Sliim](https://github.com/Sliim/emacs.d) and [Prelude](https://githu.com/bbatsov/prelude) repositories.


## Motivation

After using [Sliim](https://github.com/Sliim/emacs.d) configuration since many months, I needed to setup in my way and remove all modules that are useless for my usage.
Its configuration is a very good base for learning lisp language :)
